# Unexpected String Concatenation in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: unexpected string concatenation when performing arithmetic operations.  The issue arises when a number is added to a string, resulting in string concatenation rather than numerical addition.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected version, illustrating how to avoid the problem.

This example highlights the importance of type checking and ensuring that operands are of the correct data type before performing arithmetic operations.
